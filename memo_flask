----->Organise your directory
-One folder for the app code with: the init file, .py files, template folder(all statics files)
-test folder with all your tests
-.env: virtual environments and others
----->some useful flask objects:
*g:is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the request

*current_app: is another special object that points to the Flask application handling the request.

*open_resource(): opens a file relative to the flaskr package, which is useful since you wonâ€™t necessarily know where that location is when deploying the application later

*@click.command('commande name'): define a commande usable by invoking the flask commande

*app.teardown_appcontext(): tells Flask to call that function when cleaning up after returning the response.

*app.cli.add_command() adds a new command that can be called with the flask command.
